Question 6:
What is your process to accomplish tasks and review code?
Team members will work on completing the tasks as assigned and open pull requests 
Alex will review code before it is merged with the main branch
If files do not work as intended then the pull request will not be merged into the main branch

Question 7:
How are you going to hold each team member accountable to stay on top of their tasks?
If a team member does not follow through, then other team members will pick up the slack.
Adam will be notified of this team members lack of contribution/follow through.
Weekly check-ins on progress for each assigned task will be done to ensure team members are timely in completion.

Question 9:
Ensure your repo owner has:
* created a *private* repo
* added all team members as collaborators
* added AdamSpannbauer and abdullah-salau as collaborators
* optional (but encouraged) extra step: protect the main branch from being committed to directly

* all the above have been accomplished in the group project private repo

Provide a link to your group's repo below when those steps have been completed
